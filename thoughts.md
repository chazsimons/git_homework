- I'm also going to commit myself to taking poms. I think it's a strategy that will help my retain the new knowledge I'm gaining and allow my brain to workshop problems I encounter in my back brain.

// Shoutout to my amazing partner, Justina! She's been the wind behind me while I explore the uncharted waters of this new future.
